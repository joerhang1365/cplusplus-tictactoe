# TicTacToe
TicTacToe using C++ inside terminal? This has never been created by humans before. I would like to thank all who have supported me throughout the years such as my friends, my professors, my mother, and Sammy. Life, however, has become pointless because I am left without anything more to accomplish. Hopefully, I can peacfully live out the reset of my days in Norway.

# How to run
Goto directory
*if using linux you must make file executable by typing chmod +x tictactoe
Enter: Debug/tictactoe into terminal
Lovely
